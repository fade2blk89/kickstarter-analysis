# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns #
## Overview of Project ##
The purpose of this is to analyze Kickstarter campaign data to show trends related to goals, pledges, and the measure of success/failure rates for various types of productions

## Analysis and Challenges ##

When analyzing the data, I found that the theater productions had the highest probability of being successful, as shown below:

Upon further analysis, it appears that the subcategory of plays were the most successful in terms of theater productions that were kickstarted.

### Based on our findings, we recommend that Louise begin a kickstarter goal in May for a theater play production. This will ensure the best chance of the fundraising to be successful. ###
