# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns #
## Overview of Project ##
The purpose of this is to analyze Kickstarter campaign data to show trends related to goals, pledges, and the measure of success/failure rates for various types of productions

## Analysis and Challenges ##

When analyzing the data, I found that the theater productions had the highest probability of being successful, as shown below:

Upon further analysis, it appears that the subcategory of plays were the most successful in terms of theater productions that were kickstarted.

This is further shown when analyzing the percentages of failed vs successful theater kickstarters, as shown below. I ran into difficulty attempting to sort the pivot chart correctly and was unable to remedy it.

## Conclusion ##

Based on our findings, we recommend that Louise begin a kickstarter goal in May for a theater play production. Conversely, the theater outcomes chart shows that this type of kickstarter failing or succeeding is fairly equal when attempted in December. From the outcomes based on goal chart, we can determine that the highest successful percentage of kickstarters were for plays ranging from $1,000 to $4,999 goal. However, it is worth noting that the data set is limited by the years available (2011, 2014-2017) and we would need additional information regarding any fundraising done during the missing years.
